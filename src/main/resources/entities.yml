# RPGCore Entities Configuration
# Each entity must have: id, visibleName, entityType
# Optional attributes: level, maxHealth, health, attack, defense, speed, experienceAfterDefeat, drops, isBoss, isFriendly, hasVisibleName
#
# Custom Textures and Models:
#   texture.path: Path to texture file in /plugins/RPGCore/entities/textures/ (e.g., "bandit.png")
#   model.path: Path to custom model JSON in /plugins/RPGCore/entities/models/ (e.g., "bandit.json")
#   
#   How custom models work:
#   - When spawned, the entity will have an ItemDisplay entity riding on top of it
#   - The ItemDisplay shows your custom model
#   - The base entity is made invisible
#   - Only specify texture.path to auto-generate a simple model
#   - Or specify both texture.path and model.path for full control
#
# entityType: Valid Minecraft entity types (e.g., ZOMBIE, SKELETON, VINDICATOR, etc.)
# drops: List of item IDs from items.yml that this entity drops when defeated
#
# See ENTITY_CUSTOMIZATION.md for detailed guide on creating custom models/textures
