# RPGCore Blocks Configuration
# Each block must have: name, material
# Optional attributes: blockStateValue, hardness, resistance, minableWith, drops
#
# Custom Textures and Models:
#   texture.path: Path to texture file in /plugins/RPGCore/blocks/textures/ (e.g., "copper_ore.png")
#   model.path: Path to custom model JSON in /plugins/RPGCore/blocks/models/ (e.g., "copper_ore.json")
#   model.type: Auto-generate model based on type. Options: cube_all, cube, cube_bottom_top, cube_column, cross, orientable
#   Note: If neither model.path nor model.type is present, the block uses vanilla block.
#   Note: texture.path is required when using model.type for auto-generated models.
#
# Block Properties:
#   material: The base block type (NOTE_BLOCK is recommended for custom blocks with properties)
#   blockStateValue: The note value (0-24) used for note blocks to differentiate custom blocks
#   hardness: Mining hardness (default: 1.0)
#   resistance: Explosion resistance (default: 1.0)
#
# Minable With:
#   minableWith.materials: List of vanilla materials that can mine this block (e.g., DIAMOND_PICKAXE)
#   minableWith.items: List of RPG item keys that can mine this block
#   Note: If both lists are empty, the block can be mined with any tool
#
# Drops:
#   drops.materials: List of vanilla materials to drop (e.g., COBBLESTONE)
#   drops.items: List of RPG item keys to drop
#
# IMPORTANT: Block State Configuration
#   When using custom textures/models with NOTE_BLOCK, you must manually configure the blockstate
#   file to map note/instrument combinations to your custom models. The resource pack generator
#   creates the models and textures but does not modify the note_block.json blockstate file to
#   avoid conflicts with vanilla blocks and other plugins. You can use tools like BlockBench or
#   manually create/edit the assets/minecraft/blockstates/note_block.json file in your resource pack.
