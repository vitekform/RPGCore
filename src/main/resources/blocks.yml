# RPGCore Blocks Configuration
# Each block must have: name, material
# Optional attributes: oraxenItemId, hardness, resistance, minableWith, drops
#
# Oraxen Integration:
#   oraxenItemId: The Oraxen item ID to use for this block's visual representation and item form.
#                 The Oraxen item must be configured in Oraxen's items folder.
#                 If not specified, the block will use vanilla materials.
#
# Block Properties:
#   material: The base block type. Use BARRIER for custom blocks (invisible, provides collision).
#   hardness: Mining hardness (affects mining speed calculations)
#   resistance: Explosion resistance
#
# Minable With:
#   minableWith.materials: List of vanilla materials that can mine this block (e.g., DIAMOND_PICKAXE)
#   minableWith.items: List of RPG item keys that can mine this block
#   Note: If both lists are empty, the block can be mined with any tool
#
# Drops:
#   drops.materials: List of vanilla materials to drop (e.g., COBBLESTONE)
#   drops.items: List of RPG item keys to drop
#
# Important Notes:
#   - This system uses BARRIER + BlockDisplay architecture
#   - Physical collision is provided by BARRIER blocks (invisible)
#   - Visual representation is handled by BlockDisplay entities using Oraxen block data
#   - Oraxen plugin must be installed and configured for textures/models
#   - Block data is stored in custom_blocks.yml (BARRIER blocks don't support PDC)
