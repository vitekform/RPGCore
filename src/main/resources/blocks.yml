# RPGCore Blocks Configuration
# Each block must have: name, material
# Optional attributes: customBlockModel, hardness, resistance, minableWith, drops
#
# Custom Textures and Models:
#   texture.path: Path to texture file in /plugins/RPGCore/blocks/textures/ (e.g., "copper_ore.png")
#   model.path: Path to custom model JSON in /plugins/RPGCore/blocks/models/ (e.g., "copper_ore.json")
#   model.type: Auto-generate model based on type. Options: cube_all, cube, cube_bottom_top, cube_column, cross, orientable
#   Note: If neither model.path nor model.type is present, the block uses vanilla block.
#   Note: texture.path is required when using model.type for auto-generated models.
#
# Block Properties:
#   material: The base block type (NOTE_BLOCK is recommended for custom blocks with PDC support)
#   customBlockModel: Custom model number stored in block PDC for resource pack identification (must be unique)
#   hardness: Mining hardness (default: 1.0)
#   resistance: Explosion resistance (default: 1.0)
#
# Minable With:
#   minableWith.materials: List of vanilla materials that can mine this block (e.g., DIAMOND_PICKAXE)
#   minableWith.items: List of RPG item keys that can mine this block
#   Note: If both lists are empty, the block can be mined with any tool
#
# Drops:
#   drops.materials: List of vanilla materials to drop (e.g., COBBLESTONE)
#   drops.items: List of RPG item keys to drop
#
# IMPORTANT: Block Identification Using PDC
#   Custom blocks use PersistentDataContainer (PDC) on the block itself to store identification data.
#   The "rpg_block_id" key stores the block's unique identifier, and "custom_block_model" stores the
#   model number for resource pack hooks. This approach allows proper identification without relying
#   on note values, and enables resource packs to use the custom_block_model number for rendering.
